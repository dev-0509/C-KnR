|=> What is Padding ? :/

If number = 50, number of characters it would take when it is converted into string = 2

Now, MINIMUM_FIELD_WIDTH is a parameter which indicates minimum number of characters which 
     should be present in a string.

Thus, if MINIMUM_FIELD_WIDTH = 8, string contain minimum of 8 characters.

Thereby, to fulfill this criteria, padding is applied which ensures spaces to be fixed in if
the string does not meet the specified number of characters.

For eg, if number = 1234 and MINIMUM_FIELD_WIDTH = 8, number of characters in the string = 4
		But, the MINIMUM_FIELD_WIDTH is not met, therefore, we pad (8 - 4) = 4 spaces in the
		beginning of the string.

	=>	String should look like :- |    1234|


Happy Coding ! :)
